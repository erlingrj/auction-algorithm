- First implementation based on Edmunds works but it doesnt generate the correct values versus the stonesoup version.
- Basically what happens is that each I pick the best measurement for each track and then the last track automatically gets dumped. It is not correct.
- I should be able to unpick some measurements??

Figure this out ater. But you need a more solid understanding of what is happeniing here....
